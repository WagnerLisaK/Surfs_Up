1. The average temperature in December is about 4 degrees lower than June, which doesn't seem too bad.
2. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees versus 64 degrees in June, which is a big difference.
3. The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees versus 85 degrees in June, which is very close.

## Summary
Overall, the temperatures in June and December similar, but the lows in December means it takes longer to warm up to the high temp and the days are shorter in December.
