# Surfs_Up

## Overview
This project was to analyze the weather on the island of Oahu to determine if the weather supported opening a Surf & Ice Cream shop.

## Results
The images below display the statistics of the temperatures gathered in the month of June and December.

1. The average temperature in December is about 4 degrees lower than June, which doesn't seem too bad.
2. The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees versus 64 degrees in June, which is a big difference.
3. The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees versus 85 degrees in June, which is very close.

## Summary
Overall, the temperatures in June and December similar, but the lows in December means it takes longer to warm up to the high temp and the days are shorter in December.

When evaluating precipitation for each month, the queries and stats are below ...

December, on average, gets almost twice as much precipitation as June.  This, combined with the possible cooler temps and shorter days, the shop may make a profit in the winter time, but not near the profit between April and October.
